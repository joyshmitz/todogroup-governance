# General Member Onboarding

This guide should provide your organizaiton's representatives helpful onboarding
resources once your [TODO General Membership Application](https://todogroup.org/join/)
has been validated and processed.

An issue should have been created to process your company's membership (via this [template](/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/onboarding-general-member.md)).

If you run into any issues during the onboarding process, please reach out to the TODO Group Program Manager ([@anajsana][todo-pm]).
